## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup and ARIA attributes
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned mainly the basics of how to do client-side JavaScript validation. With functions to help with common issues and more specific problems with filling up a form.

### Useful resources

- [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info) - This page is really good for learning or at least grasping the fundamentals of modern JavaScript as well supplement what is already learned.

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - This is an amazing site to begin learning javascript as well as other technologies. Good reference material for web development topics.
